# SnippetColab
My full-stack project to solve that big headache: where did that code snippet go?!  I built this proper hub for dev teams to save, review, and comment on code in one place. It features a rich Monaco editor (just like in VS Code!) for a great coding experience. Built on the MERN stack (React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB).
